  Bubble Sort algorithm, which sorts an array by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
The algorithm iterates through the array multiple times, with each pass pushing the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end.

def bubblesort(elements):
	swapped = False
	for n in range(len(elements)-1, 0, -1):
		for i in range(n):
			if elements[i] > elements[i + 1]:
				swapped = True
				elements[i], elements[i + 1] = elements[i + 1], elements[i]	 
			return

elements = [39, 12, 18, 85, 72, 10, 2, 18]

print("Unsorted list is,")
print(elements)
bubblesort(elements)
print("Sorted Array is, ")
print(elements)
